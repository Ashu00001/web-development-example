<!-- span is inline whereas div is block -->
<!-- bold and strong do the same thing -->
<!-- strong tag is used when a line or word is very important whereas bold can be used for simple words if we want to highlight them. -->
<!-- the tags which dont take the width space and starts with newline are known as the block tag -->
<!-- the tag which takes up the width space are known as the inline tag -->

<!-- div is block tag headings are block tags -->
<!-- img tag  is inline tag anchor tag is inline tag -->
